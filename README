and multiscale molecular systems containing ENMs.

Usage: ./enm-calpha-cbeta grofile atom-identities-file ENM-bondlist-file atomistic-bondlist-file

- grofile is a standard GROMACS-format coordinate file

- atom-identities-file contains a list of the atoms from the 
  grofile which should be included in the visualisation, in the format:

#comment line
natoms
index type
index type
etc.

Possible types are: 
calpha,cbeta
C,N,O,S,H

Example atom-identities-file:

#atoms to be visualised
5
1 calpha
2 calpha
3 C
4 N
5 H



- ENM-bondlist-file contains list of bonds in ENM, format:

#comment line
n_interactions_color1 #comment
index_i index_j distance_k
index_i index_j distance_k
etc.
#comment line
#comment line
n_interactions_color2 #comment
index_i index_j distance_k
index_i index_j distance_k
etc.

In fact this is exactly the same format as the ENM bond connectivity file read by Espresso++ for ENM simulations. The first set of bonds (n_interactions_color1) are displayed in one colour and would usually be the bonded springs along the backbone. The second set of bonds (n_interactions_color2) are displayed in another colour and would usually be the 'non-bonded' springs.

Example ENM-bondlist-file:

#first read bonded interactions
3 #no. bonded interaction
1 2 0.381
2 3 0.381
3 4 0.381
4 5 0.381
5 6 0.381
#now read non-bonded interactions
#change value (nlines to read) below to change cutoff
4 #cutoff=1.1 nm
1 3 0.777
4 6 0.800
1 5 0.911
2 6 1.100

- atomistic-bondlist-file contains a list of bonds between atomistic particles, in the format

#comment line
n_bonds #comment
index_i index_j distance_k
index_i index_j distance_k
etc.

Example:

#this is a list of indices in atomistic bonds
3 #no. of bonds
20 21
20 22
20 23
